====================== CORS ISSUES HELPER ======================
Your application is experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues.
This happens because external image servers don't allow requests from your domain.

How to fix:
1. We've implemented NetworkImageWithFallback which handles CORS errors gracefully
2. For production, consider one of these approaches:
   - Use a CORS proxy service
   - Create a backend proxy endpoint to fetch images
   - Host your own images on your server
   - Use a CDN that supports proper CORS headers

====================== LAYOUT ISSUES HELPER ======================
Your application is experiencing layout issues, particularly with:
- RenderFlex children overflow
- Unbounded height constraints
- Image loading/sizing issues

How to fix:
1. We've implemented fixed height containers for component cards
2. Make sure all lists have proper sizing constraints
3. Avoid using Expanded widgets inside scrollable contexts
4. Set explicit dimensions for all network images
5. Wrap all grid elements in sized containers
